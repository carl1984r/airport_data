Welcome to Airport Data!  This gem will search for airports based on city, state, location ID or airport district office.  The search data includes the United States and its territories.  Search data includes the most recent data provided by the FAA.  


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'airport_data'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install airport_data

## Usage

To execute type ruby bin/airport after installation.  The program will first obtain updated airport data from the FAA within the United States and its territories - usually taking about a minute depending on connection speed.  The airport data menu will appear next and provide search options.  Searches are not case sensitive.
